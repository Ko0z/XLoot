# Xloot

Xloot for 1.12 Shagu Style

This is a modified version of Xloot to make it more in style with Shagu's addons like pfUI.

IMPORTANT: YOU WILL NEED pfUI by Shagu in order for this addon to work. https://github.com/shagu/pfUI

Rename the addon to just Xloot without the "-master" and put it in .../World of Warcraft/Interface/Addons.

Please note that I dont take credit for either art or code.
